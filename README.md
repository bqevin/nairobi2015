The team_projects folder contains the presentations given by all the participating Hack4Farming teams to the judges. Anyone interested in more details concerning a particular presentation should contact [the organizers](mailto:hack4eafarming@gmail.com).

##Resources
The resources kit for Hack4Farming was posted to the [aWhere developer's portal](https://developer.awhere.com/hack4farming), containing links to free or free-trial APIs, datasets, and software. The links should be continually accessible at that site, and will be added to in future events.
